# 100 Days of Code

**Main target:** ***I will code for at least an one hour every weekday for the next 100 days.***

This challenge for 100 days is to make a habit of coding to develop my skill sets to become a Frontend Developer. I was inspired by others completing the #100DaysOfCode challenge on Twitter and Discord. More details about this challenge can be found here: [100daysofcode.com](http://100daysofcode.com/ "100daysofcode.com") or [the official repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code "the official repo").

I started during late-2023, but found that my path wasn't very successful. So, I'm going to restart my progress and hopefully gain better knowldge.

- Completed building a Cafe Menu using basic CSS
- Started Dave Gray's course on HTML (finished Ch.1)
- Cleaned up notes taken from Dave Gray's course

### Link to work:
- None

### New thing(s) learned:
1. Didn't know that you could nest labels inside of inputs for forms.
2. Didn't know that you could nest a link within an image via HTML.

### Thoughts:
- There's a lot to learn about HTML when you get back into it after so long. I took Web Design in High School and everything was slow to learn. But, using something like YouTube or freeCodeCamp to help teach me makes things a lot faster. Everything seems a lot more intereting than it did before.
