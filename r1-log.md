  ### Today's Progress:
  * Completed Cat Photo App Webpage on freeCodeCamp
  * Completed building a Cafe Menu using basic CSS
  * Started Dave Gray's course on HTML (finished Ch.1)
  * Cleaned up notes taken from Dave Gray's course

  ### Link to work:
  * None

  ### New thing(s) learned:
  1. Didn't know that you could nest labels inside of inputs for forms.
  2. Didn't know that you could nest a link within an image via HTML.

  ### Thoughts:
  * There's a lot to learn about HTML when you get back into it after so long. I took Web Design in High School and everything was slow to learn. But, using something like YouTube or freeCodeCamp to help teach me makes things a lot faster. Everything seems a lot more interesting than it did before.

  ### Today's Progress:
