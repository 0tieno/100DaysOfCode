  ### Today's Progress:
  * Completed Cat Photo App Webpage on freeCodeCamp
  * Completed building a Cafe Menu using basic CSS
  * Started Dave Gray's course on HTML (finished Ch.1)
  * Cleaned up notes taken from Dave Gray's course

  ### Link to work:
  * None

  ### New thing(s) learned:
  1. Didn't know that you could nest labels inside of inputs for forms.
  2. Didn't know that you could nest a link within an image via HTML.

  ### Thoughts:
  * There's a lot to learn about HTML when you get back into it after so long. I took Web Design in High School and everything was slow to learn. But, using something like YouTube or freeCodeCamp to help teach me makes things a lot faster. Everything seems a lot more interesting than it did before.

  ### Today's Progress: 
  * Continued working on Dave Gray's Course on HTML (Ch.5 - Ch.6) *still working on Ch.6*

  ### Link to work:
  * None

  ### New thing(s) learned:
  1. Learned about the 3 different types of links (Absolute Reference, Relative Reference, and Internal Reference)
  2. Learned about the 2 different loading attributes used for images (Lazy and Eager)

  ### Thoughts:
  * Not sure how often I'll use the different types of links, but I feel as if the image attributes may be used quite often for me depending on the site. We still do live in a time where some people most likely have dial-up internet from the 90's.

  ### Today's Progress: 
  * Continued working on Dave Gray's Course on HTML (Ch.6 - Ch.9)

  ### Link to work:
  * None

  ### New thing(s) learned:
  1. Learned a lot more about HTML tables that I thought I knew in the beginning
  2. Forms have a ton of elements and attributes that can make them very helpful for submitting information about something.

  ### Thoughts:
  * I hope to create a few HTML-only projects on tables and forms so I'm able to get used to them. Probably not a big deal, but it would be something fun and new to do while learning.
