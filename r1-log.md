# Daily Log

## Day 1: Jan 2, 2024

### Today's Progress: 
- Completed Cat Photo App Webpage on freeCodeCamp
- Completed building a Cafe Menu using basic CSS
- Started Dave Gray's course on HTML (finished Ch.1)
- Cleaned up notes taken from Dave Gray's course

### Link to work:
- None

### New thing(s) learned:
1. Didn't know that you could nest labels inside of inputs for forms.
2. Didn't know that you could nest a link within an image via HTML.

### Thoughts:
- There's a lot to learn about HTML when you get back into it after so long. I took Web Design in High School and everything was slow to learn. But, using something like YouTube or freeCodeCamp to help teach me makes things a lot faster. Everything seems a lot more intereting than it did before.

### Time spent working

- 2.3 hours

## Day 2: Jan 3, 2024

### Today's Progress: 
- Continued working on Dave Gray's Course on HTML (Ch.2 - Ch.5)

### Link to work:
- None

### New thing(s) learned:
- Description Lists are something I haven't heard of before or learned about previously.

### Thoughts:
- Working hard and enjoying it!

### Time spent working

## Day 3: Jan 4, 2024

### Today's Progress: 
- Continued working on Dave Gray's Course on HTML (Ch.5 - Ch.6) *still working on Ch.6*

### Link to work:
- None

### New thing(s) learned:
- Learned about the 3 different types of links (Absolute Reference, Relative Reference, and Internal Reference)
- Learned about the 2 different loading attributes used for images (Lazy and Eager)

### Thoughts:
- Not sure how often I'll use the different types of links, but I feel as if the image attributes may be used quite often for me depending on the site. We still do live in a time where some people most likely have dial-up internet from the 90's.

### Time spent working

- 1.16 hrs

## Day 4: Jan 8, 2024

### Today's Progress: 
- Continued working on Dave Gray's Course on HTML (Ch.6 - Ch.9)

### Link to work:
- None

### New thing(s) learned:
- Learned a lot more about HTML tables that I thought I knew in the beginning
- Forms have a ton of elements and attributes that can make them very helpful for submitting information about something.

### Thoughts:
- I hope to create a few HTML-only projects on tables and forms so I'm able to get used to them. Probably not a big deal, but it would be something fun and new to do while learning.

### Time spent working

- 2.33 hrs

## Day 5: Jan 9, 2024

### Today's Progress: 
- Completed Dave Gray's course on HTML by completing the final project

### Link to work:
- [Little Taco Shop - GitHub](https://github.com/kylecreate/LTS)

### New thing(s) learned:
- The difference of using articles and sections. After watching his solution, I changed my sections to articles and changed a few things around as well.

### Thoughts:
- I enjoyed working on this project. Before I start learning CSS, I'm going to find a few more HTML projects to work on to get more of an understanding of the language. I believe 2-3 projects should be good.

### Time spent working

- 2.5hrs

## Day 6: Jan 10, 2024

### Today's Progress: 
- Started and completed the MDN project of creating a table of planets data

### Link to work:

### Link to work:

### New thing(s) learned:
- I've learned the differences between RGB, RGBA, HSL, HSLA, and Hexcodes. For the future whenever I create a website, I'll probably use RGB and RGBA. What do most developers use?

### Thoughts:
